## LLM Support Bot

## Overview

The backend contains the Python code for ingesting data from Github
Discussions and Issues, writing that data to a vector database, and
providing an API for responding to questions via an LLM and context
from the database.

The frontend is a simple web interface for asking questions and
getting answers from the API.
